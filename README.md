# Portfolio-optimization-with-python

In this code, I have used the TAQ data for one day ( March 1, 2021) and calculated 

1. the dollar volume today for all stocks, 

2. changed the dollar volume to negative for stocks sold, 

3. grouped the data in ascending order by dollar volume, 

4. sorted out out #top 5, middle 5, last 5performing stocks, 

5. created a table for returning stock return in annual terms, 

6. plotted the #top 5, middle 5, last 5 performing stocks' returns.
